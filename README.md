# IntVector2
A simple class for those who need an integer vector (x,y) struct for c# gamedev (Unity). Its so simple...why would you use mine? Because mine:

 * Implements equality operators.
 * Has helper methods such as Left(), Right(), Up(), Down()
 * Utility classes for translating/rotating arrays of vectors.
 * Serializable.
 * Useful statics for IntVector2.zero, IntVector2.one, IntVector2.neg1.
